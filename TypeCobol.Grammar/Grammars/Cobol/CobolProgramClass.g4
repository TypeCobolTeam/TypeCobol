//       are grouped into the following four divisions : 
//       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION,ENVIRONMENT DIVISION,DATA DIVISION,PROCEDURE DIVISION

// p83 : The end of a COBOL source program is indicated by the END PROGRAM marker.
//       If there are no nested programs, the absence of additional source program lines
//       also indicates the end of a COBOL program.

// p97 : The IDENTIFICATION DIVISION must be the first division in each COBOL source
// program, factory definition, object definition, and method definition. The
// identification division names the program, class, or method and identifies the

// p89 : Enterprise COBOL provides object-oriented syntax to facilitate interoperation of

//       You can use object-oriented syntax to:

//       - Invoke methods on Java or COBOL objects
//       - Write classes that inherit from Java classes or from other COBOL classes

// p91 : With the exception of the COPY and REPLACE statements and the END CLASS

// For a class, the first paragraph of the IDENTIFICATION DIVISION must
// be the CLASS-ID paragraph. The other paragraphs are optional and can

// assigns selected attributes to that method. The METHOD-ID paragraph is required
// and must be the first paragraph in a method identification division.

// p94 : Methods defined in an object definition are instance methods. An instance method in
//      a given class can access:
// - Data defined in the DATA DIVISION of the object paragraph of that class
//   (instance data)
// - Data defined in the DATA DIVISION of that instance method (method data)
// An instance method cannot directly access instance data defined in a parent class,
// factory data defined in its own class, or method data defined in another method of
// its class. It must invoke a method to access such data.

// p94 : Methods defined in a factory definition are factory methods. A factory method in a
//      given class can access:
// - Data defined in the DATA DIVISION of the factory paragraph of that class
//   (factory data)
// - Data defined in the DATA DIVISION of that factory method (method data)
// A factory method cannot directly access factory data defined in a parent class,
// instance data defined in its own class, or method data defined in another method
// of its class. It must invoke a method to access such data.

// p94 : Methods can be invoked from COBOL programs and methods, and they can be
// invoked from Java programs. A method can execute an INVOKE statement that
// directly or indirectly invokes itself. Therefore, COBOL methods are implicitly
// recursive (unlike COBOL programs, which support recursion only if the
// RECURSIVE attribute is specified in the program-ID paragraph.)

// p109 : The configuration section is an optional section for programs and classes, and can

// The configuration section can:
// - Relate IBM-defined environment-names to user-defined mnemonic names
// - Specify the collating sequence
// - Specify a currency sign value, and the currency symbol used in the PICTURE
//   clause to represent the currency sign value
// - Exchange the functions of the comma and the period in PICTURE clauses and
//   numeric literals
// - Relate alphabet-names to character sets or collating sequences
// - Specify symbolic characters
// - Relate class-names to sets of characters
// - Relate object-oriented class names to external class-names and identify
//   class-names that can be used in a class definition or program
// - Relate xml-schema-names to ddnames or environment variable names
//   identifying files containing XML schemas

// p109 : Program configuration section
// The configuration section can be specified only in the ENVIRONMENT

// Entries in a class configuration section apply to the entire class definition,

// Program data division 
// The DATA DIVISION of a COBOL source program describes, in a structured manner, all the data to be processed by the program.

// The object data division contains data description entries for instance object data (instance data). Instance data is defined in the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION of the object paragraph of a class definition. 
// Factory data division 
// The factory data division contains data description entries for factory object data (factory data). Factory data is defined in the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION of the factory paragraph of a class definition. 
// Method data division 
// A method data division contains data description entries for data accessible within the method. A method data division can contain a LOCAL-STORAGE SECTION or a WORKING-STORAGE SECTION, or both. The term method data applies to both. Method data in LOCAL-STORAGE is dynamically allocated and initialized on each invocation of the method; method data in WORKING-STORAGE is static and persists across invocations of the method.

// p154: Format: program and method data division

// record-description-entry 
// A set of data description entries (described in Chapter 18, “DATA DIVISION--data description entry,” on page 185) that describe the particular records contained within a particular file. 
// A record in the FILE SECTION must be described as an alphanumeric group item, a national group item, or an elementary data item of class alphabetic, alphanumeric, DBCS, national, or numeric.
// More than one record description entry can be specified; each is an alternative description of the same record storage area.
// Data areas described in the FILE SECTION are not available for processing unless the file that contains the data area is open.

// p278: Conditional statements
// A conditional statement specifies that the truth value of a condition is to be
// determined and that the subsequent action of the object program is dependent on
// this truth value.
// For more information about conditional expressions, see “Conditional expressions”
// on page 256.)
// The following lists contain COBOL statements that become conditional when a
// condition (for example, ON SIZE ERROR or ON OVERFLOW) is included and
// when the statement is not terminated by its explicit scope terminator.
// Arithmetic
// - ADD ... ON SIZE ERROR
// - ADD ... NOT ON SIZE ERROR
// - COMPUTE ... ON SIZE ERROR
// - COMPUTE ... NOT ON SIZE ERROR
// - DIVIDE ... ON SIZE ERROR
// - DIVIDE ... NOT ON SIZE ERROR
// - MULTIPLY ... ON SIZE ERROR
// - MULTIPLY ... NOT ON SIZE ERROR
// - SUBTRACT ... ON SIZE ERROR

// p280: Delimited scope statements
// In general, a DELIMITED SCOPE statement uses an explicit scope terminator to
// turn a conditional statement into an imperative statement.
// The resulting imperative statement can then be nested. Explicit scope terminators
// can also be used to terminate the scope of an imperative statement. Explicit scope
// terminators are provided for all COBOL statements that can have conditional
// phrases.
// Unless explicitly specified otherwise, a delimited scope statement can be specified
// wherever an imperative statement is allowed by the rules of the language.
// Explicit scope terminators
// An explicit scope terminator marks the end of certain PROCEDURE DIVISION
// statements.
// A conditional statement that is delimited by its explicit scope terminator is
// considered an imperative statement and must follow the rules for imperative
// statements.
// These are the explicit scope terminators:
// - END-ADD
// - END-CALL
// - END-COMPUTE
// - END-DELETE
// - END-DIVIDE
// - END-EVALUATE
// - END-IF
// - END-INVOKE
// - END-MULTIPLY
// - END-PERFORM
// - END-READ
// - END-RETURN
// - END-REWRITE
// - END-SEARCH
// - END-START
// - END-STRING
// - END-SUBTRACT
// - END-UNSTRING
// - END-WRITE
// - END-XML
// Implicit scope terminators
// At the end of any sentence, an implicit scope terminator is a separator period that
// terminates the scope of all previous statements not yet terminated.
// An unterminated conditional statement cannot be contained by another statement.
// Except for nesting conditional statements within IF statements, nested statements
// must be imperative statements and must follow the rules for imperative
// statements. You should not nest conditional statements.
