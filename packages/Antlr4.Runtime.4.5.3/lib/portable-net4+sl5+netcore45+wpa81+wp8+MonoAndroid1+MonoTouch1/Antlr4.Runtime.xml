            A simple stream of symbols whose values are represented as integers. This
            interface provides <em>marked ranges</em> with support for a minimum level
            of buffering necessary to implement arbitrary lookahead during prediction.

            An ATN transition between any two ATN states.  Subclasses define
            atom, set, epsilon, action, predicate, rule transitions.
            <p>This is a one way link.  It emanates from a state (usually via a list of

            <p>Since we never have to change the ATN transitions once we construct it,
            we can fix these transitions as specific classes. The DFA transitions
            on the other hand need to update the labels as it adds transitions to
            the states. We'll use the term Edge for the DFA to distinguish them from
            ATN transitions.</p>

            <remarks>
            This class represents profiling event information for an ambiguity.
            Ambiguities are decisions where a particular input resulted in an SLL
            conflict, followed by LL prediction also reaching a conflict state
            (indicating a true ambiguity in the grammar).
            <p>
            This event may be reported during SLL prediction in cases where the
            conflicting SLL configuration set provides sufficient information to
            determine that the SLL conflict is truly an ambiguity. For example, if none
            of the ATN configurations in the conflicting SLL configuration set have
            traversed a global follow transition (i.e.
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfig.ReachesIntoOuterContext"/>
            is
            <see langword="false"/>
            for all
            configurations), then the result of SLL prediction for that input is known to
            be equivalent to the result of LL prediction for that input.</p>
            <p>
            In some cases, the minimum represented alternative in the conflicting LL
            configuration set is not equal to the minimum represented alternative in the
            conflicting SLL configuration set. Grammars and inputs which result in this
            scenario are unable to use
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionMode.Sll"/>
            , which in turn means
            they cannot use the two-stage parsing strategy to improve parsing performance
            for that input.</p>

            <remarks>
            This is the base class for gathering detailed information about prediction
            events which occur during parsing.
            Note that we could record the parser call stack at the time this event
            occurred but in the presence of left recursive rules, the stack is kind of
            meaningless. It's better to look at the individual configurations for their
            individual stacks. Of course that is a
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContext"/>
            object
            not a parse tree node and so it does not have information about the extent
            (start...stop) of the various subtrees. Examining the stack tops of all
            configurations provide the return states for the rule invocations.
            From there you can get the enclosing rule.

            Gets whether or not the configuration conflict is an exact conflict.
            An exact conflict occurs when the prediction algorithm determines that
            the represented alternatives for a particular configuration set cannot be
            further reduced by consuming additional input. After reaching an exact
            conflict during an SLL prediction, only switch to full-context prediction
            could reduce the set of viable alternatives. In LL prediction, an exact
            conflict indicates a true ambiguity in the input.

            This class represents profiling event information for a context sensitivity.
            Context sensitivities are decisions where a particular input resulted in an
            SLL conflict, but LL prediction produced a single unique alternative.
            <p>
            In some cases, the unique alternative identified by LL prediction is not
            equal to the minimum represented alternative in the conflicting SLL
            configuration set. Grammars and inputs which result in this scenario are

            This class contains profiling gathered for a particular decision.
            <p>
            Parsing performance in ANTLR 4 is heavily influenced by both static factors
            (e.g. the form of the rules in the grammar) and dynamic factors (e.g. the
            choice of input and the state of the DFA cache at the time profiling
            operations are started). For best results, gather and use aggregate
            statistics from a large sample of inputs representing the inputs expected in
            production before using the results to make changes in the grammar.</p>

            <p>We track these variables separately for the DFA and ATN simulation

            <summary>The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.</summary>
            <remarks>
            The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.
            <p>
            The basic complexity of the adaptive strategy makes it harder to understand.
            We begin with ATN simulation to build paths in a DFA. Subsequent prediction
            requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for
            the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to
            complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state
            or uniquely predicting state).</p>
            <p>
            All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create
            a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a
            prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not
            necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA
            caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack
            created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if
            prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context
            stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we
            don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing
            strategy (versus full LL(*)).</p>
            <p>
            When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and
            retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding
            to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks
            from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can
            definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we
            don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer
            context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive
            grammars.)</p>
            <p>
            The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA
            simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.
            This is slow because we can't save the results and have to "interpret" the
            ATN each time we get that input.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS</strong></p>
            <p>
            We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and
            that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set
            of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the
            context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache
            tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower
            than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of
            memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like
            to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve
            the speed of parsing across a large number of files.</p>
            <p>
            There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,
            which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that
            we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That
            implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to
            resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position
            in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in
            input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the
            full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the
            original A B C.	To make a	prediction cache work, we have to track	the exact
            input	used during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps
            X to a specific DFA for that context.</p>
            <p>
            Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are
            likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry
            with full LL thing Sam does.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION</strong></p>
            <p>
            We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not
            dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,
            or when we force SLL mode.</p>
            <p>
            As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super
            constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like
            this:</p>
            <pre>
            ctorBody
            : '{' superCall? stat* '}'
            ;
            </pre>
            <p>
            Or, you might see something like</p>
            <pre>
            stat
            : superCall ';'
            | expression ';'
            | ...
            ;
            </pre>
            <p>
            In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer
            context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.
            In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the
            entry rule and not dip into the outer context.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>PREDICATES</strong></p>
            <p>
            Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and
            LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as
            it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate
            evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL
            ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during
            closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't
            build up a suitable DFA.</p>
            <p>
            When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any
            predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is
            more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,
            we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have
            true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all
            alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that
            remains.</p>
            <p>
            When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test
            those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no
            alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.</p>
            <p>
            During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and
            on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during
            closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,
            without this on-the-fly evaluation.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>SHARING DFA</strong></p>
            <p>
            All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a
            static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the
            same
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATN.decisionToDFA"/>
            field. They also share a
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContextCache"/>
            object that makes sure that all
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContext"/>
            objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes
            a big size difference.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>THREAD SAFETY</strong></p>
            <p>
            The
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ParserATNSimulator"/>
            locks on the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATN.decisionToDFA"/>
            field when
            it adds a new DFA object to that array.
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ParserATNSimulator.AddDFAEdge(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState,System.Int32,Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState)"/>
            locks on the DFA for the current decision when setting the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState.edges"/>
            field.
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ParserATNSimulator.AddDFAState(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContextCache)"/>
            locks on
            the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it
            already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that
            are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of
            threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ParserATNSimulator.AddDFAState(Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet,Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContextCache)"/>
            method also locks inside the DFA lock
            but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the
            configurations'
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.PredictionContext"/>
            objects using cached
            subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is
            safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing
            <c>s.edge[t]</c>
            get the same physical target
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState"/>
            , or
            <see langword="null"/>
            . Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFA.states"/>
            map. It follows the
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState.edges"/>
            field to new
            targets. The DFA simulator will either find
            <see cref="F:Antlr4.Runtime.Dfa.DFAState.edges"/>
            to be
            <see langword="null"/>
            , to be non-
            <see langword="null"/>
            and
            <c>dfa.edges[t]</c>
            null, or
            <c>dfa.edges[t]</c>
            to be non-null. The

            method could be racing to set the field
            but in either case the DFA simulator works; if
            <see langword="null"/>
            , and requests ATN
            simulation. It could also race trying to get

            <p>
            If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax
            error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.</p>
            <p>
            The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the
            grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,
            the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a
            subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,
            then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL
            set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision
            is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the
            SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would
            rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's
            the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL
            analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an
            alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same
            alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting
            alternatives.</p>
            <p>
            Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives
            <c/>
            
            1, 2, 3}} and
            a smaller LL set called <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em> is
            <c/>
            
            2, 3}}, then SLL
            parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If
            <em>s</em> is
            <c/>
            
            1, 2}} or
            <c/>
            
            1, 3}} then both SLL and LL will
            choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either
            set. If <em>s</em> is
            <c/>
            
            2}} or
            <c/>
            
            3}} then SLL will get a syntax
            error. If <em>s</em> is
            <c/>
            
            1}} then SLL will succeed.</p>
            <p>
            Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in
            both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over
            the input.</p>

            Performs ATN simulation to compute a predicted alternative based
            upon the remaining input, but also updates the DFA cache to avoid
            having to traverse the ATN again for the same input sequence.
            There are some key conditions we're looking for after computing a new
            set of ATN configs (proposed DFA state):
            if the set is empty, there is no viable alternative for current symbol
            does the state uniquely predict an alternative?
            does the state have a conflict that would prevent us from
            putting it on the work list?
            if in non-greedy decision is there a config at a rule stop state?
            We also have some key operations to do:
            add an edge from previous DFA state to potentially new DFA state, D,
            upon current symbol but only if adding to work list, which means in all
            cases except no viable alternative (and possibly non-greedy decisions?)
            collecting predicates and adding semantic context to DFA accept states
            adding rule context to context-sensitive DFA accept states
            consuming an input symbol
            reporting a conflict
            reporting an ambiguity
            reporting a context sensitivity
            reporting insufficient predicates
            We should isolate those operations, which are side-effecting, to the
            main work loop. We can isolate lots of code into other functions, but
            they should be side effect free. They can return package that
            indicates whether we should report something, whether we need to add a
            DFA edge, whether we need to augment accept state with semantic
            context or rule invocation context. Actually, it seems like we always
            add predicates if they exist, so that can simply be done in the main
            loop for any accept state creation or modification request.
            cover these cases:
            dead end

            <ul>
            <li>The closure block cannot contain any epsilon transitions which bypass
            the body of the closure, so all states reachable via alternative 1 are

            epsilon transition, so the only way an alternative other than 1 can exist
            in a state that is also reachable via alternative 1 is by nesting calls
            to the left-recursive rule, with the outer calls not being at the
            preferred precedence level. The

            The SLL(*) prediction mode. This prediction mode ignores the current
            parser context when making predictions. This is the fastest prediction
            mode, and provides correct results for many grammars. This prediction
            mode is more powerful than the prediction mode provided by ANTLR 3, but

            prediction mode,
            it may be due to either an actual syntax error in the input or indicate

            ensured regardless of how the termination condition is computed by this

            prediction should only fall back to LL when the additional lookahead
            cannot lead to a unique SLL prediction.</p>
            <p>Assuming combined SLL+LL parsing, an SLL configuration set with only
            conflicting subsets should fall back to full LL, even if the
            configuration sets don't resolve to the same alternative (e.g.

            3,4}}. If there is at least one non-conflicting
            configuration, SLL could continue with the hopes that more lookahead will
            resolve via one of those non-conflicting configurations.</p>
            <p>Here's the prediction termination rule them: SLL (for SLL+LL parsing)
            stops when it sees only conflicting configuration subsets. In contrast,
            full LL keeps going when there is uncertainty.</p>
            <p><strong>HEURISTIC</strong></p>
            <p>As a heuristic, we stop prediction when we see any conflicting subset
            unless we see a state that only has one alternative associated with it.
            The single-alt-state thing lets prediction continue upon rules like
            (otherwise, it would admit defeat too soon):</p>
            <p>
            <c>[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;</c>
            </p>
            <p>When the ATN simulation reaches the state before
            <c>';'</c>
            , it has a
            DFA state that looks like:
            <c>[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]</c>
            . Naturally
            <c>12|1|[]</c>
            and
            <c>12|2|[]</c>
            conflict, but we cannot stop
            processing this node because alternative to has another way to continue,
            via
            <c>[6|2|[]]</c>
            .</p>
            <p>It also let's us continue for this rule:</p>
            <p>
            <c>[1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]] a : A | A | A B ;</c>
            </p>
            <p>After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
            State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
            conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
            However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not stop
            working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned with
            states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt 3 is not
            associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
            looking for input reasonably, don't declare the state done.</p>
            <p><strong>PURE SLL PARSING</strong></p>
            <p>To handle pure SLL parsing, all we have to do is make sure that we
            combine stack contexts for configurations that differ only by semantic
            predicate. From there, we can do the usual SLL termination heuristic.</p>
            <p><strong>PREDICATES IN SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
            <p>SLL decisions don't evaluate predicates until after they reach DFA stop
            states because they need to create the DFA cache that works in all
            semantic situations. In contrast, full LL evaluates predicates collected
            during start state computation so it can ignore predicates thereafter.
            This means that SLL termination detection can totally ignore semantic
            predicates.</p>
            <p>Implementation-wise,
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet"/>
            combines stack contexts but not
            semantic predicate contexts so we might see two configurations like the
            following.</p>
            <p>
            <c/>
            (s, 1, x,
            ), (s, 1, x', {p})}</p>
            <p>Before testing these configurations against others, we have to merge
            <c>x</c>
            and
            <c>x'</c>
            (without modifying the existing configurations).
            For example, we test
            <c>(x+x')==x''</c>
            when looking for conflicts in
            the following configurations.</p>
            <p>
            <c/>
            (s, 1, x,
            ), (s, 1, x', {p}), (s, 2, x'', {})}</p>
            <p>If the configuration set has predicates (as indicated by
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet.HasSemanticContext"/>
            ), this algorithm makes a copy of
            the configurations to strip out all of the predicates so that a standard
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfigSet"/>
            will merge everything ignoring predicates.</p>

            <remarks>
            Full LL prediction termination.
            <p>Can we stop looking ahead during ATN simulation or is there some
            uncertainty as to which alternative we will ultimately pick, after
            consuming more input? Even if there are partial conflicts, we might know
            that everything is going to resolve to the same minimum alternative. That
            means we can stop since no more lookahead will change that fact. On the
            other hand, there might be multiple conflicts that resolve to different
            minimums. That means we need more look ahead to decide which of those
            alternatives we should predict.</p>
            <p>The basic idea is to split the set of configurations
            <c>C</c>
            , into
            conflicting subsets
            <c>(s, _, ctx, _)</c>
            and singleton subsets with
            non-conflicting configurations. Two configurations conflict if they have
            identical
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfig.State"/>
            and
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfig.Context"/>
            values
            but different
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfig.Alt"/>
            value, e.g.
            <c>(s, i, ctx, _)</c>
            and
            <c>(s, j, ctx, _)</c>
            for
            <c>i!=j</c>
            .</p>
            <p/>
            Reduce these configuration subsets to the set of possible alternatives.
            You can compute the alternative subsets in one pass as follows:
            <p/>
            <c/>
            A_s,ctx =
            i | (s, i, ctx, _)}} for each configuration in
            <c>C</c>
            holding
            <c>s</c>
            and
            <c>ctx</c>
            fixed.
            <p/>
            Or in pseudo-code, for each configuration
            <c>c</c>
            in
            <c>C</c>
            :
            <pre>
            map[c] U= c.
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATNConfig.Alt">getAlt()</see>
            # map hash/equals uses s and x, not
            alt and not pred
            </pre>
            <p>The values in
            <c>map</c>
            are the set of
            <c>A_s,ctx</c>
            sets.</p>
            <p>If
            <c>|A_s,ctx|=1</c>
            then there is no conflict associated with
            <c>s</c>
            and
            <c>ctx</c>
            .</p>
            <p>Reduce the subsets to singletons by choosing a minimum of each subset. If
            the union of these alternative subsets is a singleton, then no amount of
            more lookahead will help us. We will always pick that alternative. If,
            however, there is more than one alternative, then we are uncertain which
            alternative to predict and must continue looking for resolution. We may
            or may not discover an ambiguity in the future, even if there are no
            conflicting subsets this round.</p>
            <p>The biggest sin is to terminate early because it means we've made a
            decision but were uncertain as to the eventual outcome. We haven't used
            enough lookahead. On the other hand, announcing a conflict too late is no
            big deal; you will still have the conflict. It's just inefficient. It
            might even look until the end of file.</p>
            <p>No special consideration for semantic predicates is required because
            predicates are evaluated on-the-fly for full LL prediction, ensuring that
            no configuration contains a semantic context during the termination
            check.</p>
            <p><strong>CONFLICTING CONFIGS</strong></p>
            <p>Two configurations
            <c>(s, i, x)</c>
            and
            <c>(s, j, x')</c>
            , conflict
            when
            <c>i!=j</c>
            but
            <c>x=x'</c>
            . Because we merge all
            <c>(s, i, _)</c>
            configurations together, that means that there are at
            most
            <c>n</c>
            configurations associated with state
            <c>s</c>
            for
            <c>n</c>
            possible alternatives in the decision. The merged stacks
            complicate the comparison of configuration contexts
            <c>x</c>
            and
            <c>x'</c>
            . Sam checks to see if one is a subset of the other by calling
            merge and checking to see if the merged result is either
            <c>x</c>
            or
            <c>x'</c>
            . If the
            <c>x</c>
            associated with lowest alternative
            <c>i</c>
            is the superset, then
            <c>i</c>
            is the only possible prediction since the
            others resolve to
            <c>min(i)</c>
            as well. However, if
            <c>x</c>
            is
            associated with
            <c>j&gt;i</c>
            then at least one stack configuration for
            <c>j</c>
            is not in conflict with alternative
            <c>i</c>
            . The algorithm
            should keep going, looking for more lookahead due to the uncertainty.</p>
            <p>For simplicity, I'm doing a equality check between
            <c>x</c>
            and
            <c>x'</c>
            that lets the algorithm continue to consume lookahead longer
            than necessary. The reason I like the equality is of course the
            simplicity but also because that is the test you need to detect the
            alternatives that are actually in conflict.</p>
            <p><strong>CONTINUE/STOP RULE</strong></p>
            <p>Continue if union of resolved alternative sets from non-conflicting and
            conflicting alternative subsets has more than one alternative. We are
            uncertain about which alternative to predict.</p>
            <p>The complete set of alternatives,
            <c>[i for (_,i,_)]</c>
            , tells us which
            alternatives are still in the running for the amount of input we've
            consumed at this point. The conflicting sets let us to strip away
            configurations that won't lead to more states because we resolve
            conflicts to the configuration with a minimum alternate for the
            conflicting set.</p>

            two or one and three so we keep going. We can only stop prediction when
            we need exact ambiguity detection when the sets look like

            At the point of LL failover, we record how SLL would resolve the conflict so that
            we can determine whether or not a decision / input pair is context-sensitive.
            If LL gives a different result than SLL's predicted alternative, we have a
            context sensitivity for sure. The converse is not necessarily true, however.
            It's possible that after conflict resolution chooses minimum alternatives,
            SLL could get the same answer as LL. Regardless of whether or not the result indicates
            an ambiguity, it is not treated as a context sensitivity because LL prediction
            was not required in order to produce a correct prediction for this decision and input sequence.
            It may in fact still be a context sensitivity but we don't know by looking at the
            minimum alternatives for the current input.

            The interface for defining strategies to deal with syntax errors encountered
            during a parse by ANTLR-generated parsers. We distinguish between three
            different kinds of errors:
            <ul>
            <li>The parser could not figure out which path to take in the ATN (none of
            the available alternatives could possibly match)</li>
            <li>The current input does not match what we were looking for</li>
            <li>A predicate evaluated to false</li>
            </ul>
            Implementations of this interface report syntax errors by calling

            at this point in the ATN. You can call this anytime but ANTLR only
            generates code to check before subrules/loops and each iteration.
            <p>Implements Jim Idle's magic sync mechanism in closures and optional
            subrules. E.g.,</p>
            <pre>
            a : sync ( stuff sync )* ;
            sync : {consume to what can follow sync} ;
            </pre>
            At the start of a sub rule upon error,
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.DefaultErrorStrategy.Sync(Antlr4.Runtime.Parser)"/>
            performs single
            token deletion, if possible. If it can't do that, it bails on the current
            rule and uses the default error recovery, which consumes until the
            resynchronization set of the current rule.
            <p>If the sub rule is optional (
            <c>(...)?</c>
            ,
            <c>(...)*</c>
            , or block
            with an empty alternative), then the expected set includes what follows
            the subrule.</p>
            <p>During loop iteration, it consumes until it sees a token that can start a
            sub rule or what follows loop. Yes, that is pretty aggressive. We opt to
            stay in the loop as long as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>ORIGINS</strong></p>
            <p>Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within loops.
            A single mismatch token or missing token would force the parser to bail
            out of the entire rules surrounding the loop. So, for rule</p>
            <pre>
            classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
            </pre>
            input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
            consume until it found the next class definition rather than the next
            member definition of the current class.
            <p>This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser has to
            compare token set at the start of the loop and at each iteration. If for
            some reason speed is suffering for you, you can turn off this
            functionality by simply overriding this method as a blank { }.</p>

            Conjure up a missing token during error recovery.
            The recognizer attempts to recover from single missing
            symbols. But, actions might refer to that missing symbol.
            For example, x=ID {f($x);}. The action clearly assumes
            that there has been an identifier matched previously and that
            $x points at that token. If that token is missing, but
            the next token in the stream is what we want we assume that
            this token is missing and we keep going. Because we
            have to return some token to replace the missing token,
            we have to conjure one up. This method gives the user control
            over the tokens returned for missing tokens. Mostly,
            you will want to create something special for identifier
            tokens. For literals such as '{' and ',', the default
            action in the parser or tree parser works. It simply creates
            a CommonToken of the appropriate type. The text will be the token.
            If you change what tokens must be created by the lexer,
            override this method to create the appropriate tokens.

            A DFA state represents a set of possible ATN configurations.
            As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
            to keep track of all possible states the ATN can be in after
            reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
            input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
            subset T of the states of the ATN that are reachable from the
            ATN's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
            In conventional NFA&#x2192;DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
            would be a bitset representing the set of states the
            ATN could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
            state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
            a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
            jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
            I have to add a stack to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
            the underlying LL grammar from which the ATN was derived.
            <p>I use a set of ATNConfig objects not simple states.  An ATNConfig
            is both a state (ala normal conversion) and a RuleContext describing
            the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.</p>
            <p>A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
            but with different ATN contexts (with same or different alts)
            meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.</p>

            A rule invocation record for parsing.
            Contains all of the information about the current rule not stored in the
            RuleContext. It handles parse tree children list, Any ATN state
            tracing, and the default values available for rule invocations:
            start, stop, rule index, current alt number.
            Subclasses made for each rule and grammar track the parameters,
            return values, locals, and labels specific to that rule. These
            are the objects that are returned from rules.
            Note text is not an actual field of a rule return value; it is computed
            from start and stop using the input stream's toString() method.  I
            could add a ctor to this so that we can pass in and store the input
            stream, but I'm not sure we want to do that.  It would seem to be undefined
            to get the .text property anyway if the rule matches tokens from multiple
            input streams.
            I do not use getters for fields of objects that are used simply to
            group values such as this aggregate.  The getters/setters are there to
            satisfy the superclass interface.

            <summary>A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation.</summary>
            <remarks>
            A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation.
            We form a stack of these context objects using the parent
            pointer. A parent pointer of null indicates that the current
            context is the bottom of the stack. The ParserRuleContext subclass
            as a children list so that we can turn this data structure into a
            tree.
            The root node always has a null pointer and invokingState of -1.
            Upon entry to parsing, the first invoked rule function creates a
            context object (asubclass specialized for that rule such as
            SContext) and makes it the root of a parse tree, recorded by field
            Parser._ctx.
            public final SContext s() throws RecognitionException {
            SContext _localctx = new SContext(_ctx, getState()); &lt;-- create new node
            enterRule(_localctx, 0, RULE_s);                     &lt;-- push it
            ...
            exitRule();                                          &lt;-- pop back to _localctx
            return _localctx;
            }
            A subsequent rule invocation of r from the start rule s pushes a
            new context object for r whose parent points at s and use invoking
            state is the state with r emanating as edge label.
            The invokingState fields from a context object to the root
            together form a stack of rule indication states where the root
            (bottom of the stack) has a -1 sentinel value. If we invoke start
            symbol s then call r1, which calls r2, the  would look like
            this:
            SContext[-1]   &lt;- root node (bottom of the stack)
            R1Context[p]   &lt;- p in rule s called r1
            R2Context[q]   &lt;- q in rule r1 called r2
            So the top of the stack, _ctx, represents a call to the current
            rule and it holds the return address from another rule that invoke
            to this rule. To invoke a rule, we must always have a current context.
            The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and
            getting error information.
            These objects are used during parsing and prediction.
            For the special case of parsers, we use the subclass

            <remarks>
            The goal of all lexer rules/methods is to create a token object.
            This is an instance variable as multiple rules may collaborate to
            create a single token.  nextToken will return this object after
            matching lexer rule(s).  If you subclass to allow multiple token
            emissions, then set this to the last token to be matched or
            something nonnull so that the auto token emit mechanism will not
            emit another token.

            and emits it.

            <remarks>
            Override this parser interpreters normal decision-making process
            at a particular decision and input token index. Instead of
            allowing the adaptive prediction mechanism to choose the
            first alternative within a block that leads to a successful parse,
            force it to take the alternative, 1..n for n alternatives.
            As an implementation limitation right now, you can only specify one
            override. This is sufficient to allow construction of different
            parse trees for ambiguous input. It means re-parsing the entire input
            in general because you're never sure where an ambiguous sequence would
            live in the various parse trees. For example, in one interpretation,
            an ambiguous input sequence would be matched completely in expression
            but in another it could match all the way back to the root.
            s : e '!'? ;
            e : ID
            | ID '!'
            ;
            Here, x! can be matched as (s (e ID) !) or (s (e ID !)). In the first
            case, the ambiguous sequence is fully contained only by the root.
            In the second case, the ambiguous sequences fully contained within just
            e, as in: (e ID !).
            Rather than trying to optimize this and make
            some intelligent decisions for optimization purposes, I settled on
            just re-parsing the whole input and then using
            {link Trees#getRootOfSubtreeEnclosingRegion} to find the minimal
            subtree that contains the ambiguous sequence. I originally tried to
            record the call stack at the point the parser detected and ambiguity but
            left recursive rules create a parse tree stack that does not reflect
            the actual call stack. That impedance mismatch was enough to make
            it it challenging to restart the parser at a deeply nested rule
            invocation.
            Only parser interpreters can override decisions so as to avoid inserting
            override checking code in the critical ALL(*) prediction execution path.

            <remarks>
            Useful for rewriting out a buffered input token stream after doing some
            augmentation or other manipulations on it.
            <p>
            You can insert stuff, replace, and delete chunks. Note that the operations
            are done lazily--only if you convert the buffer to a
            <see cref="T:System.String"/>
            with
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.ITokenStream.GetText"/>
            . This is very efficient because you are not
            moving data around all the time. As the buffer of tokens is converted to
            strings, the
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText"/>
            method(s) scan the input token stream and
            check to see if there is an operation at the current index. If so, the
            operation is done and then normal
            <see cref="T:System.String"/>
            rendering continues on the
            buffer. This is like having multiple Turing machine instruction streams
            (programs) operating on a single input tape. :)</p>
            <p>
            This rewriter makes no modifications to the token stream. It does not ask the
            stream to fill itself up nor does it advance the input cursor. The token
            stream
            <see cref="P:Antlr4.Runtime.IIntStream.Index"/>
            will return the same value before and
            after any
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText"/>
            call.</p>
            <p>
            The rewriter only works on tokens that you have in the buffer and ignores the
            current input cursor. If you are buffering tokens on-demand, calling
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText"/>
            halfway through the input will only do rewrites for those
            tokens in the first half of the file.</p>
            <p>
            Since the operations are done lazily at
            <see cref="M:Antlr4.Runtime.TokenStreamRewriter.GetText"/>
            -time, operations do
            not screw up the token index values. That is, an insert operation at token
            index
            <c>i</c>
            does not change the index values for tokens
            <c>i</c>
            +1..n-1.</p>
            <p>
            Because operations never actually alter the buffer, you may always get the
            original token stream back without undoing anything. Since the instructions
            are queued up, you can easily simulate transactions and roll back any changes
            if there is an error just by removing instructions. For example,</p>
            <pre>
            CharStream input = new ANTLRFileStream("input");
            TLexer lex = new TLexer(input);
            CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lex);
            T parser = new T(tokens);
            TokenStreamRewriter rewriter = new TokenStreamRewriter(tokens);
            parser.startRule();
            </pre>
            <p>
            Then in the rules, you can execute (assuming rewriter is visible):</p>
            <pre>
            Token t,u;
            ...
            rewriter.insertAfter(t, "text to put after t");}
            rewriter.insertAfter(u, "text after u");}
            System.out.println(rewriter.getText());
            </pre>
            <p>
            You can also have multiple "instruction streams" and get multiple rewrites
            from a single pass over the input. Just name the instruction streams and use
            that name again when printing the buffer. This could be useful for generating
            a C file and also its header file--all from the same buffer:</p>
            <pre>
            rewriter.insertAfter("pass1", t, "text to put after t");}
            rewriter.insertAfter("pass2", u, "text after u");}
            System.out.println(rewriter.getText("pass1"));
            System.out.println(rewriter.getText("pass2"));
            </pre>
            <p>
            If you don't use named rewrite streams, a "default" stream is used as the
            first example shows.</p>

            The interval refers to the indexes in the original token stream.
            We do not alter the token stream in any way, so the indexes
            and intervals are still consistent. Includes any operations done
            to the first and last token in the interval. So, if you did an
            insertBefore on the first token, you would get that insertion.
            The same is true if you do an insertAfter the stop token.

            <remarks>
            We need to combine operations and report invalid operations (like
            overlapping replaces that are not completed nested). Inserts to
            same index need to be combined etc...  Here are the cases:
            I.i.u I.j.v								leave alone, nonoverlapping
            I.i.u I.i.v								combine: Iivu
            R.i-j.u R.x-y.v	| i-j in x-y			delete first R
            R.i-j.u R.i-j.v							delete first R
            R.i-j.u R.x-y.v	| x-y in i-j			ERROR
            R.i-j.u R.x-y.v	| boundaries overlap	ERROR
            Delete special case of replace (text==null):
            D.i-j.u D.x-y.v	| boundaries overlap	combine to max(min)..max(right)
            I.i.u R.x-y.v | i in (x+1)-y			delete I (since insert before
            we're not deleting i)
            I.i.u R.x-y.v | i not in (x+1)-y		leave alone, nonoverlapping
            R.x-y.v I.i.u | i in x-y				ERROR
            R.x-y.v I.x.u 							R.x-y.uv (combine, delete I)
            R.x-y.v I.i.u | i not in x-y			leave alone, nonoverlapping
            I.i.u = insert u before op @ index i
            R.x-y.u = replace x-y indexed tokens with u
            First we need to examine replaces. For any replace op:
            1. wipe out any insertions before op within that range.
            2. Drop any replace op before that is contained completely within
            that range.
            3. Throw exception upon boundary overlap with any previous replace.
            Then we can deal with inserts:
            1. for any inserts to same index, combine even if not adjacent.
            2. for any prior replace with same left boundary, combine this
            insert with replace and delete this replace.
            3. throw exception if index in same range as previous replace
            Don't actually delete; make op null in list. Easier to walk list.
            Later we can throw as we add to index &#x2192; op map.
            Note that I.2 R.2-2 will wipe out I.2 even though, technically, the
            inserted stuff would be before the replace range. But, if you
            add tokens in front of a method body '{' and then delete the method
            body, I think the stuff before the '{' you added should disappear too.
            Return a map from token index to operation.

            Associate a property with a parse tree node. Useful with parse tree listeners

            specifying a return value for the listener event method that visited a
            particular node. Example:
            <pre>
            ParseTreeProperty&lt;Integer&gt; values = new ParseTreeProperty&lt;Integer&gt;();
            values.put(tree, 36);

            values.removeFrom(tree);
            </pre>
            You would make one decl (values here) in the listener and use lots of times
            in your event methods.

            pattern in string form before using it.</p>
            <p>The lexer and parser that you pass into the
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Tree.Pattern.ParseTreePatternMatcher"/>
            constructor are used to parse the pattern in string form. The lexer converts
            the
            <c>&lt;ID&gt; = &lt;expr&gt;;</c>
            into a sequence of four tokens (assuming lexer
            throws out whitespace or puts it on a hidden channel). Be aware that the
            input stream is reset for the lexer (but not the parser; a
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.ParserInterpreter"/>
            is created to parse the input.). Any user-defined
            fields you have put into the lexer might get changed when this mechanism asks
            it to scan the pattern string.</p>
            <p>Normally a parser does not accept token
            <c>&lt;expr&gt;</c>
            as a valid
            <c>expr</c>
            but, from the parser passed in, we create a special version of
            the underlying grammar representation (an
            <see cref="T:Antlr4.Runtime.Atn.ATN"/>
            ) that allows imaginary
            tokens representing rules (
            <c>&lt;expr&gt;</c>
            ) to match entire rules. We call
            these <em>bypass alternatives</em>.</p>
            <p>Delimiters are

            , with

            as the escape string

            <remarks>
            Represents a placeholder tag in a tree pattern. A tag can have any of the
            following forms.
            <ul>
            <li>
            <c>expr</c>
            : An unlabeled placeholder for a parser rule
            <c>expr</c>

            <li>
            <c>ID</c>
            : An unlabeled placeholder for a token of type
            <c>ID</c>
            .</li>
            <li>

            : A labeled placeholder for a parser rule
            <c>expr</c>

            This class does not perform any validation on the tag or label names aside
            from ensuring that the tag is a non-null, non-empty string.
