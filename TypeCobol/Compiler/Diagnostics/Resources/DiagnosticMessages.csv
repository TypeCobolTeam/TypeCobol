2;16;1;Invalid numeric literal format : expecting integer +12, or decimal +12,345, or floating point +12.345E-03;1;37;A numeric literal is a character-string whose characters are selected from the digits 0 through 9, a sign character (+ or -), and the decimal point. Only one sign character is allowed. If included, it must be the leftmost character of the literal. If the literal is unsigned, it is a positive value. Only one decimal point is allowed. The decimal point can appear anywhere within the literal except as the rightmost character.
2;17;1;Invalid floating point numeric literal format : a decimal point must be included in the mantissa 1.23E+4;1;38;"Format for floating-point literals : ('+' | '-')? mantissa 'E' ('+' | '-')? exponent. The sign is optional before the mantissa and the exponent; if you omit the sign, the compiler assumes a positive number. The mantissa can contain between one and 16 digits. A decimal point must be included in the mantissa. The exponent is represented by an E followed by an optional sign and one or two digits."
2;18;1;Invalid floating point numeric literal format : the exponent is represented by an E followed by an optional sign and one or two digits (E+99);1;38;"Format for floating-point literals : ('+' | '-')? mantissa 'E' ('+' | '-')? exponent.

2;21;1;The first non blank character of this continuation line must be {0} (continuation of the alphanumeric literal on the previous line);1;55;If the continued line contains an alphanumeric or national literal, the continuation line must contain a hyphen in the indicator area, and the first nonblank character must be a quotation mark
2;22;1;Because the alphanumeric literal on the previous line ended with a delimiter {0} in the last column,  this continuation line must start with two delimiters {0}{0};1;55;If an alphanumeric literal that is to be continued on the next line has as its last character a quotation mark in column 72, the continuation line must start with two consecutive quotation marks
