    /// The EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure is executed:
    /// * Either after completing the system-defined input/output error routine, or
    /// * Upon recognition of an INVALID KEY or AT END condition when an INVALID
    /// KEY or AT END phrase has not been specified in the input/output statement, or
    /// * Upon recognition of an IBM-defined condition that causes file status key 1 to be
    /// set to 9. (See “File status key” on page 287.)

    /// After execution of the EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure, control is returned to the
    /// invoking routine in the input/output control system. If the input/output status
    /// value does not indicate a critical input/output error, the input/output control
    /// system returns control to the next executable statement following the input/output
    /// statement whose execution caused the exception.
    ///
    /// An applicable EXCEPTION/ERROR procedure is activated when an input/output
    /// error occurs during execution of a READ, WRITE, REWRITE, START, OPEN,
    /// CLOSE, or DELETE statement. To determine what conditions are errors, see
    /// “Common processing facilities” on page 286.

    /// * A declarative procedure can be performed from a nondeclarative procedure.
    /// * A nondeclarative procedure can be performed from a declarative procedure.
    /// * A declarative procedure can be referenced in a GO TO statement in a declarative
    /// procedure.
    /// * A nondeclarative procedure can be referenced in a GO TO statement in a
    /// declarative procedure.
