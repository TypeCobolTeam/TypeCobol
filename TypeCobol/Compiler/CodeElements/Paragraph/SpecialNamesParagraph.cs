    /// - The order in which literals appear specifies the ordinal number,
    /// in ascending sequence, of the characters in this collating
    /// sequence.
    /// - Each numeric literal specified must be an unsigned integer.
    /// - Each numeric literal must have a value that corresponds to a
    /// valid ordinal position within the collating sequence in effect.
    /// - Each character in an alphanumeric literal represents that actual
    /// character in the character set. (If the alphanumeric literal
    /// contains more than one character, each character, starting with
    /// the leftmost, is assigned a successively ascending position within
    /// this collating sequence.)
    /// - Any characters that are not explicitly specified assume positions
    /// in this collating sequence higher than any of the explicitly
    /// specified characters. The relative order within the collating
    /// sequence of these unspecified characters is their relative order in
    /// the collating sequence indicated by the COLLSEQ compiler
    /// option.
    /// - Within one alphabet-name clause, a given character must not be
    /// specified more than once.
    /// - Each alphanumeric literal associated with a THROUGH or ALSO
    /// phrase must be one character in length.
    /// - When the THROUGH phrase is specified, the contiguous
    /// characters in the native character set beginning with the
    /// character specified by literal-1 and ending with the character
    /// specified by literal-2 are assigned successively ascending
    /// positions in this collating sequence.
    /// This sequence can be either ascending or descending within the
    /// original native character set. That is, if "Z" THROUGH "A" is
    /// specified, the ascending values, left-to-right, for the uppercase
    /// letters are:
    /// ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
    /// - When the ALSO phrase is specified, the characters specified as
    /// literal-1, literal-3, ... are assigned to the same position in this
    /// collating sequence. For example, if you specify:
    /// "D" ALSO "N" ALSO "%"
    /// the characters D, N, and % are all considered to be in the same
    /// position in the collating sequence.
    /// - When the ALSO phrase is specified and alphabet-name-1 is
    /// referenced in a SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause, only literal-1
    /// is used to represent the character in the character set.
    /// - The character that has the highest ordinal position in this
    /// collating sequence is associated with the figurative constant
    /// HIGH-VALUE. If more than one character has the highest
    /// position because of specification of the ALSO phrase, the last
    /// character specified (or defaulted to when any characters are not
    /// explicitly specified) is considered to be the HIGH-VALUE
    /// character for procedural statements such as DISPLAY and as the
    /// sending field in a MOVE statement. (If the ALSO phrase
    /// example given above were specified as the high-order characters
    /// of this collating sequence, the HIGH-VALUE character would be

    /// collating sequence is associated with the figurative constant
    /// LOW-VALUE. If more than one character has the lowest position
    /// because of specification of the ALSO phrase, the first character
    /// specified is the LOW-VALUE character. (If the ALSO phrase
