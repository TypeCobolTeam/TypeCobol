    /// The ALTER statement encourages the use of unstructured programming practices;
    /// the EVALUATE statement provides the same function as the ALTER statement but
    /// helps to ensure that a program is well-structured.
    ///
    /// The ALTER statement acts as a program switch, allowing, for example, one
    /// sequence of execution during initialization and another sequence during the bulk
    /// of file processing.
    ///
    /// Altered GO TO statements in programs with the INITIAL attribute are returned to
    /// their initial states each time the program is entered.
    ///
    /// Do not use the ALTER statement in programs that have the RECURSIVE attribute,
    /// in methods, or in programs compiled with the THREAD option.

    /// Segmentation considerations
    ///
    /// A GO TO statement that is coded in an independent segment must not be
    /// referenced by an ALTER statement in a segment with a different priority-number.
    /// All other uses of the ALTER statement are valid and are performed even if the GO
    /// TO referenced by the ALTER statement is in a fixed segment.
    ///
    /// Altered GO TO statements in independent segments are returned to their initial
    /// state when control is transferred to the independent segment that contains the
    /// ALTERED GO TO from another independent segment with a different
    /// priority-number.
    ///
    /// This transfer of control can take place because of:
    /// * The effect of previous statements
    /// * An explicit transfer of control with a PERFORM or GO TO statement
    /// * A sort or merge statement with the INPUT or OUTPUT phrase specified
